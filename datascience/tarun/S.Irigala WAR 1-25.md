### Summary/Remarks:

- I am still looking into data warehousing and machine learning, and working on those skills.

- I met with Vorpal with Dane at Synapse, and they're a company that workes with the government and other cities to identify targets with drones using RF. Reaching out to them to potentially bring them in.
